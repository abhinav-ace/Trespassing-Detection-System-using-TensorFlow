# PROJECT-Trespassing-object-identification
Overview: The project is developed in python language and uses predefined Tensorflow library to detect objects and hence spots a trespass.       

Models used: We have shown two different models that actually process the images and helps us to spot any animal or human in the image. 

Concept used: Machine learning (Image processing and object identification)     

Areas of use: This project can be utilised to spot any tresspassing object and to differentiate whether it was a human or animal, moreover a same sort of technology can be used by wildlife sanctuaries and national parks to keep a record of animals when they cross any camera. Adding to it, this is just a prototype and it gives us an idea of areas in which it can be utilised but one may find some innovative approach to utilise it.

Language used: Python

Library used: Tensorflow is used majorly along with many supporting files.

Software used: Jupyter notebook

Images database: COCOAPI (Link-https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi) This API has a lot of images on which the model is trained. The test images are just googled and the machine learning model is tested on it.
